      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p class="intro">I am a passionate sales person who has earned his spurs at large companies such as Monster and de Persgroep. Sales is what I am. But in addition, I have always had a lot of interest in web development from a young age, but never did anything with it. Due to the Corana crisis, I had a lot of time to rethink things and decided to turn myself completely into a full slack developer. I am driven and decisive and with my focus I know that I will succeed. I look forward to eventually becoming successful in this as well.</p>
